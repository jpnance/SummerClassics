1. change dates in .env
	- SEASON
	- OPENING_DAY
	- JACKIE_ROBINSON_DAY (probably just April 15th)
	- PLAYERS_WEEKEND (probably won't know this at the beginning of the year)
	- FINAL_DAY

2. node bin/schedule.js
	- this will populate the schedule for the season
	- this relies on SEASON, OPENING_DAY, and FINAL_DAY being correct
